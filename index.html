                        <p>Welcome! My name is Serena and this is a collection of food that I made in my Kerrey Hall dorm! I am not the best chief in the world but here are some very informal recipes that I made so unless you are absolutely ready to waste some food, feel free to try them. The recipes are very vague as I tend to cook whatever is in my fridge and add flavorings based on whatever mood I am that day, so in a way this is my personal recipe book! Below are filters to help sort out food by their types for possibly easier navigation! Once you have decided on a dish you like, click on the image and it will lead you to that dishes detail. Information that will be shown includes: the dishes name, estimated cooking time, ingredients needed, procedures to follow, estimated cooking time, and health benefits of an ingredient in the recipe! Enjoy and don't get food poisoning~</p>
